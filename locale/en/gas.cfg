bzgas-recipe-bypass=Skip modifying these recipes (comma-separated list).
bzgas-list=If enabled, the text command [color=orange]BZList[/color] will dump a file to the script-output directory with a full list of recipes modified.\nRecommended to turn this off after you are done configuring your other settings.
bzgas-boiler=Natural gas mod currnelty can incorporate ElAdamo's public domain fluid boiler. If that mod is updated to 1.1, this may be removed.
bzgas-handcraft=This enables an alternative wood-based handcrafting-only recipe for electronic circuits. Defaults to off, as bakelite only takes a few steps to make, but provided to enable varying playstyles.
